# The master database is the database settend in config/database.yml
# This supports both sharding and replication, you could select the shards, and for default just replicated
# database will be used, the master database is in database.yml and the slave will only be awesome_slave.
# Setting Load balancing for default will be true, octopus will send all your read queries to slaves, and writes queries to 
# master. if you just want some queries to send to slaves, set it to false, and use the sintax User.using(:slave).
